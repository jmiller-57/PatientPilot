Working Title: 	Patient Navigator— Support for each step in the patient journey
Author: 		Andrew Varyu*

1. Vision & Differentiator
A patient-centric healthcare navigation app designed to:
* Use the patient journey itself as the organizing interface.

* Provide clarity, transparency, and emotional support across all stages of care.

* Integrate AI for real-time Q&A, billing interpretation, reminders, and visit prep.

* Layer onto multiple EHRs (Epic, Cerner, etc.) rather than being locked to one.

* Include a contextual Wiki to explain healthcare concepts, accordion-style, always linked back to the patient’s place in the journey.


2. Patient Journey as Core UX Framework
* Journey structured as scrollable rectangles (steps).

* Each step expands to its own landing page with: overview, quick tips, tools, and wiki links.

* Patient can “zoom in and out” of details, always able to return to the journey.

* Grid created with Journey Steps ? Pain Points ? Potential App Features (partially filled; some areas still blank to be developed).

3. Major Orienting Questions
These are strategic forks that will determine feasibility and scope:
1. EHR Integration / MyChart Access
o Can patients link their MyChart account? Likely difficult — Epic rarely offers API access without corporate agreements.
o Backup: Allow patients to upload/download MyChart visit summaries, or forward emailed appointment reminders to a unique app address, or screenshot/upload appointment details. App parses and integrates automatically.

2. Appointment & Visit Integration Without API
o Email forwarding ? Parsing appointment details.
o Screenshot upload ? OCR parsing.
o Manual entry as fallback.

3. Insurance & Coverage Guidance
o Intake: Upload insurance card/photo.
o AI parses payer/plan, looks up network and cost coverage where possible.
o Guidance: steer toward in-network providers, flag likely out-of-pocket risks.

4. Medical Liability
o AI symptom/medical info is advisory, never diagnostic.
o Content sourcing: clearly labeled (Mayo, Healthline, PubMed, etc.).
o Disclaimers: “For educational purposes only, not a substitute for medical advice.”
o Backups: curated plain-language educational summaries.

5. Business Model
o Free baseline: core journey tools, wiki access, reminders, symptom search.
o Paid one-time unlock / subscription: storage of doctor conversation history, expanded data storage, advanced billing/EOB tools, long-term health record organization.

6. Data & Sources
o Free sources: PubMed abstracts, CDC, NIH, Mayo, Healthline, CMS (billing codes).
o API-required: EHR access (Epic/Cerner, usually not available without enterprise deal).
o Commercial partnership required: insurance plan lookup, claims databases.
o Backup Plan: If APIs not available, provide manual input + educational lookups so app retains value.

4. Defensible IP Elements
* The journey-based UI framework (patients navigating through healthcare by scrolling through the actual patient journey).

* The Wiki-overlay model with accordion context + “return to journey” flow.

* Integration methods that don’t rely on corporate partnerships (email forwarding, screenshot parsing, document/photo uploads).

* Billing/EOB comparison with AI interpretation and patient-task reminders
